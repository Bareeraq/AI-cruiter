Go through all the instructions carefully.  
Extract the following information from the given resume:  
1. Name  
2. Contact Number  
3. Email Address  
4. Education (Highest degree)  
5. Current Company Name  
6. Current Location - must be only the current location - one location like the city  
7. Primary Skills  
8. Secondary Skills  
9. Total Experience (in years)  
10. Relevant Experience in Primary Skills (in years)  
11. Relevant Experience in Secondary Skills (in years)  
12. Experience in Skills: For each relevant skill (only significant skills), analyze the resume text carefully to determine the candidate's experience in years. Output this as a nested JSON object under the key `"Experience in Skills"`. Each skill should be a key, and its value should be the years of experience as an integer. For example:

```json
"Experience in Skills": {
    "Angular": 9,
    "Node.js": 5,
    "Docker": 3,
    "MongoDB": 4
}
Ensure all fields have values. If any value is missing or cannot be found, set it as 'NA'.
Do not include any additional text or explanations in the output. Provide only key-value pairs in JSON format.
Remove any markdown formatting like asterisks from the output.
If irrelevant data or an invalid document is provided, respond with: "Please upload a valid resume."
Analyze only the text data of a resume. Resume Text: {resume_text}
